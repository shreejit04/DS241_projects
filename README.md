## DS241_projects

This repository contains all the projects I did in DS 241 class.

In this class, we did the following projects:

1. COVID Data Analysis: In this project we studied the cases and deaths for various states in th US and compared the cumulative cases for selected states.
2. DS in a Box (Lab 04): This lab is to verify a joke made famous by Mitch Hedberg who said "La Quinta means right next to Denny's". In this lab we explored the validity of this joke and along the way learned some more data wrangling and tips for visualizing spatial data.
3. DS in a Box (Lab 05): In this lab we revisited the Dennyâ€™s and La Quinta Inn and Suites data we visualized in the previous lab, but we focus on specific states and compare each restaurant individually.
4. Lab 5 (comparing with other fast foods): In this project, we compared the closeness of Dennys and La Quinta relative to other restaurants from a data set provided to us in class.
5. MA 132 Enrollments: The main goal for this project was o predict enrollment for MA 132 in Spring 2022. The data was from the Mathematics Department of Clarkson University.
6. Bike Rentals: In this project, we visualized rentals for different times, distances traveled by bikes and other basic rental details.
7. DC Bikeshare Tutorial: This tutorial was based on understanding the changes in bike rentals with respect to various natural aspects such as weather, season, temperature etc.
8. DC Crime Analysis: We used the crime data available at Open Data DC to compare crimes from 2017 - 2021. The main purpose of this project was to study if the crimes affected DC Bike Rentals in any way. I also included some analysis of the crime data related to COVID-19.
